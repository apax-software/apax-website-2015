            <p>Yes, we're here to help your company. We're entrepreneurs and know what it's like to get started. We 
          recognize that early-stage companies are often strapped for cash, so we don't want to take a chunk out
          of your already limited resources. This also aligns our incentives long-term. We only succeed if you succeed,
          so our team is committed to helping you out for the life of your startup (and likely beyond that).</p>

            <p>Most importantly, we look for founders that are committed and hustle.  We can be most helpful to companies that create or utilize web and mobile software to deliver value to their customers. We have supported both b2b and b2c companies in industries ranging from sports and pets to hospitality and healthcare.  You can see a sample of the companies we’ve worked with so far in our <a href="/#portfolio">portfolio here.</a>

            <p>We require monthly accountability meetings with each startup. We prefer that these be completed in person but can be a phone call or google hangout when needed. We also have quarterly mentor sessions which teams are expected to attend. These typically take place at Awesome Inc over lunch and last approximately 2 hours.  Other than that, there are a lot of other offerings included in the program, but none of them are required.  You’ll get out of the program what you put in.</p>
